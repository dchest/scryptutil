COMMAND

    scryptutil encrypts and decrypts files.

    Files are encrypted with AES-256 in CTR mode and are authenticated with
    HMAC-SHA256. The key is derived from passphrase using scrypt key
    derivation function.

    Usage:

	scryptutil {enc | dec} infile [outfile]

    If outfile is not given, the program writes to the standard output.

    scryptutil is a Go reimplementation of Colin Percival's scrypt utility,
    which is used to encrypt key files for his Tarsnap backup service (see
    http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html).

INSTALLATION

    $ go get github.com/dchest/scryptutil

BUGS

    Parameters for KDF during encryption are hardcoded to N=2ยนโด, r=8, p=1.

    Passwords are echoed to terminal when entering them.

    None of the original scrypt utility flags are supported.
